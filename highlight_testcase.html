<p>While blog-writer Aaron (a non-Japanese intern working for a company that builds Japanese toilets) may have been exaggerating for effect, the point still stands. The Japanese do not generally regard it as a good thing to attempt to level the playing field as assertiveness encourages, and appear unthreatened by deferential conduct that would make many Westerners wince. Submission to the authority of others, raising others up above the self – these are strategies for ensuring group harmony which is highly prized in the East. It should be noted that ethology suggests that in many animal packs, displays of submission are just as crucial as dominance displays in ensuring the smooth functioning of the group and its ability to provide for its constituent members. Protocols of dominance and submission often forestall the need for full-on bloody fights that the pack can ill afford.</p>

<p>Even here in the West it turns out that you can have too much of a supposedly good thing. A study by Daniel Ames and Francis Flynn at Columbia University discovered that, when it comes to people’s appraisal of leadership qualities, too much assertiveness was generally regarded by employees to be just as problematic as too little. It seemed a ‘Goldilocks algorithm’ was at work that left leaders at the higher end of the assertiveness spectrum just as compromised as if they were perceived as lacking in assertiveness. The authors point out that ‘Although a high level of assertiveness may entail instrumental benefits, it often carries social costs. Assertive people tend to be seen as less likeable and less friendly than unassertive people, even when assertive behaviour is considered effective, justified, and appropriate ... even kinder and gentler versions of assertiveness are seen as leading to worse impressions than are low levels of assertiveness.’ How very surprising this is, considering that assertive communication supposedly places such emphasis on respectful interaction, mutual validation of everyone’s point of view and represents a mature and moderate approach to resolving conflict ... But on the other hand, if the lines between assertiveness and aggression are more blurred than everyone wishes to believe, then perhaps we shouldn’t be that surprised after all.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, and slightly at odds with the Ames and Flynn study, an analysis of what makes good companies become great ones identified ‘level five leadership’ as one of the crucial determinants. Publishing his findings in the Harvard Business Review, Jim Collins concluded that outstandingly successful companies often seemed to be led by individuals with two distinct qualities: personal humility and professional will power. These leaders were markedly unassuming in a way that contradicts the stereotype of what an assertive person should look like. Describing them as paradoxically ‘timid and ferocious’ and ‘modest and wilful’, Collins goes on to give examples of leaders who often proved strikingly self-effacing at interview, including one level five leader who confided (or even asserted): ‘There are a lot of people in this company who could do this job better than I do.’ While coming across as genuinely humble and unassuming individuals, where these men and women did not hold back was in relentlessly and single-mindedly pushing through the reforms, policies and redundancies they believed were in the interest of their companies – even when these involved controversial or unpopular choices. Here some kind of assertiveness was clearly at work, but not assertiveness geared to the service of the ego or the advancement of the individual in the way we equate with assertiveness. Instead it was applied with steely determination to the interests of the wider collective, while their own egos took a back seat.</p>

<p>Assertiveness in the form with which we are familiar may be warranted on occasion, but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s going to help us win any popularity contests or that when harnessed to advancing our personal agendas (even legitimate ones) our assertive behaviour isn’t going to be interpreted by others as an act of war. I know of one highly assertive man who informed a superior that he experienced his boss’s body language as anxiety-provoking. This ticked all the assertiveness boxes: the man in question was only saying what he felt and how he interpreted the other person’s actions; he wasn’t directly blaming the boss; he took responsibility for his own reactions to her. However, suffice it to say that a few days later he found that he had been marginalised within the organisation and his performance was suddenly being negatively appraised. There may be no connection at all, but you have to wonder ...</p>

<p>It seems to me that truly effective communication is a dance in which we have to be prepared to move fluidly between different and complementary roles, even if that means sometimes holding the high status position and sometimes agreeing to be what is known in sadomasochistic circles as ‘the bottom’. Ames and Flynn compare the use of assertiveness with seasoning a meal: too little and it tastes bland, but too much and the dish is ruined. Insisting that we can maintain respectful equality at all times is a pleasant fantasy, but it certainly isn’t going to be realised by using techniques which often amount to no more than a form of manipulation to get our needs met. In the Hindu faith ‘the sound of I’ must be silenced before you can get in touch with deeper levels of reality. Perhaps we should bear this in mind before we get too sold on techniques that ultimately are just designed to pump up the volume.</p>
